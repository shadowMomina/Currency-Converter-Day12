This is **Day 12** of my 90-Day Coding Series.  
It’s a beginner-friendly Python script that converts amounts between different currencies using fixed exchange rates (no external APIs).  
The code is fully commented to help beginners understand every step.

## Features
- Convert an entered amount from one currency to another.
- Choose from a predefined list of currencies.
- Simple menu interface for ease of use.

Converted amount: 27950.00 PKR
```
